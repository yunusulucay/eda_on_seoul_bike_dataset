Exploratory data analysis on Seoul Bike dataset using Dask. The Data used include trip duration, trip distance, pickup-dropoff latitude and longitude, temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity, solar radiation, snowfall, ground temperature and 1-hour average dust concentration.
Goal is to predict the trip duration. But we only focus on Analyzing the data and working with Dask.
Dask is used to parallel processing. So this will give us fast processing capacity and working with large datasets.
